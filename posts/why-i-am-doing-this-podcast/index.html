<h3>Transcript</h3>
<p>Welcome to The Star Base Cafe.</p>
<p>Hello, this is Rill, and you are listening to Episode One: Why I am
doing this podcast</p>
<p>a while back, I think it was 2006 I found out about
<a href="https://www.nanowrimo.org/">NanoWriMo</a> National Novel Writing Month.
And in 2006, I couldn't participate. But at the beginning of 2007, I
started writing, trying to write with the National Novel Writing Month
principles of just write, don't edit, just keep going. I didn't quite
finish a novel. But later that year, I finished a novel. And year
after year, I wrote a novel</p>
<p>, introducing some of the same characters and developing a storyline.
But no matter how hard I have tried, I can't go back to the original
novel and finish it. And I can't seem to edit any of the other novels
to make them useful. And yet, I still keep thinking about the novels and
the characters.</p>
<p>So I have begun to wonder if I'm not a novelist, but that I am a person
who likes to tell stories. And I like to think about stories and try to
work out their plot and what people are doing. It's all the other
connected stuff that I'm not very good at.</p>
<p>So I thought it might be fun to start this podcast and imagine that we
are at a cafe. I have set this :cafe in a fictional seaside town called
not surprisingly Ril, because some online folks started to tease me that
I was a seaside town in Wales, because apparently, there is such a town.
Although its spelled r h y l, where I spell Rill R i l l. So I started
to run with that and just try to think about the sounds and the
appointments of the fictional seaside town of Rill. And then I thought
this seaside town should have a cafe.</p>
<p>And I've always liked the idea of calling a place, the star base cafe,
even though we are not somewhere out there in the galaxy.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>orbiting a planet or a strange star or a strange moon. It's all part of
the fiction. I also thought from time to time, the characters I have
thought about and been friends with all these years could appear after
all, their fiction too. So why can't a fictional character come to a
fictional cafe in a fictional seaside town? You see how this works?</p>
<p>The segments of this podcast may be short, may be long, may be frequent,
may be infrequent. We'll just see how it goes.</p>
<p>I may give you a peek into my real life.</p>
<p>Talk to you later.</p>
<p>I transcribed this using <a href="https://otter.ai">otter.ai</a>and I have cleaned
it up where necessary but I have made no effort to turn this into a
proper essay.</p>
