Welcome to The Star Base Cafe.

Hello, this is Rill, and you are listening to Episode One: Why I am
doing this podcast

a while back, I think it was 2006 I found out about
[NanoWriMo](https://www.nanowrimo.org/) National Novel Writing Month.
And in 2006, I couldn't participate. But at the beginning of 2007, I
started writing, trying to write with the National Novel Writing Month
principles of just write, don't edit, just keep going. I didn't quite
finish a novel. But later that year, I finished a novel. And year
after year, I wrote a novel

, introducing some of the same characters and developing a storyline.
But no matter how hard I have tried, I can't go back to the original
novel and finish it. And I can't seem to edit any of the other novels
to make them useful. And yet, I still keep thinking about the novels and
the characters.

So I have begun to wonder if I'm not a novelist, but that I am a person
who likes to tell stories. And I like to think about stories and try to
work out their plot and what people are doing. It's all the other
connected stuff that I'm not very good at.

So I thought it might be fun to start this podcast and imagine that we
are at a cafe. I have set this :cafe in a fictional seaside town called
not surprisingly Ril, because some online folks started to tease me that
I was a seaside town in Wales, because apparently, there is such a town.
Although its spelled r h y l, where I spell Rill R i l l. So I started
to run with that and just try to think about the sounds and the
appointments of the fictional seaside town of Rill. And then I thought
this seaside town should have a cafe.

And I've always liked the idea of calling a place, the star base cafe,
even though we are not somewhere out there in the galaxy.

orbiting a planet or a strange star or a strange moon. It's all part of
the fiction. I also thought from time to time, the characters I have
thought about and been friends with all these years could appear after
all, their fiction too. So why can't a fictional character come to a
fictional cafe in a fictional seaside town? You see how this works?

The segments of this podcast may be short, may be long, may be frequent,
may be infrequent. We'll just see how it goes.

I may give you a peek into my real life.

Talk to you later.

I transcribed this using [otter.ai](https://otter.ai)and I have cleaned
it up where necessary but I have made no effort to turn this into a
proper essay.
